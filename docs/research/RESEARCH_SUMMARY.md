# Go vs Java Debug Adapter Research - Executive Summary

**Research Date**: October 8, 2025
**Duration**: ~4 hours of comprehensive research
**Objective**: Determine which language to add next to debugger-mcp

---

## Executive Recommendation

### **Add Go (Delve) support next, then Java**

---

## Key Research Findings

### Go (Delve) ✅ RECOMMENDED

**Pros**:
- ✅ Native DAP support (no translation layer)
- ✅ Simple installation: `go install dlv`
- ✅ TCP Socket transport (80% code reuse from Ruby/Node.js)
- ✅ Clean architecture, no dependencies
- ✅ Estimated implementation: **1.5-2 days**

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Users must have Go installed
- ⚠️ Single-use server (not actually a problem)

### Java (java-debug) ⏱️ LATER

**Pros**:
- ✅ Comprehensive JVM debugging
- ✅ Mature ecosystem
- ✅ Widely used language

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Complex multi-component architecture (jdt.ls + java-debug + JDWP)
- ⚠️ Requires Java 21+, Eclipse JDT Language Server, Maven
- ⚠️ DAP → JDWP translation layer
- ⚠️ Complex installation and setup
- ⚠️ Estimated implementation: **5-6 days**
- ⚠️ Higher maintenance burden

## Evidence-Based Decision

### Why Go First?

**1. Architectural Simplicity**
```
Go:  AI → MCP → debugger-mcp → dlv dap → Go program
                                  (DAP)

Java: AI → MCP → debugger-mcp → jdt.ls → java-debug → JDWP → JVM
                                  (LSP)     (DAP)      (JDWP)
```

**2. Code Reuse**

Go adapter (30 lines, core spawn function):
```rust
pub async fn spawn(program: &str, args: &[String]) -> Result<GoDebugSession> {
    let port = socket_helper::find_free_port()?;  // REUSE
    let child = Command::new("dlv")
        .args(&["dap", "--listen", &format!("127.0.0.1:{}", port)])
        .spawn()?;
    let socket = socket_helper::connect_with_retry(port).await?;  // REUSE
    Ok(GoDebugSession { process: child, socket, port })
}
```

Java adapter (80+ lines, requires new LSP infrastructure):
```rust
pub async fn spawn(main_class: &str) -> Result<JavaDebugSession> {
    // 1. Check if jdt.ls is running (complex state management)
    // 2. Send LSP command: vscode.java.startDebugSession
    // 3. Wait for callback with port
    // 4. Connect to port
    // NEW: LSP client, NEW: JdtLsManager, NEW: command protocol
}
```

**3. Installation Experience**

Go:
```bash
go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest
dlv version
# Done in 30 seconds
```

Java:
```bash
# Install Java 21+
# Download Eclipse JDT LS (100+ MB)
# Build java-debug with Maven
# Configure bundles paths
# Verify everything works
# Takes 5-10 minutes, many failure points
```

**4. Risk Assessment**

| Risk Category | Go | Java |
|---------------|----|----|
| Technical | Low | High |
| Dependency | Low (dlv) | High (Java 21+, jdt.ls, java-debug) |
| User Setup | Low | High |
| Maintenance | Low | Medium-High |
| Implementation | Low | Medium |

## Strategic Benefits of Go First

1. **Momentum**: Quick win validates adapter pattern for compiled languages
2. **Learning**: Lessons from Go inform Java implementation
3. **Confidence**: Proves architecture is sound before tackling complexity
4. **User Value**: Go users get support sooner
5. **Risk Mitigation**: If Java blocks, we still have Go progress
6. **Team Morale**: Success builds confidence for harder work

## Validation Approach

Following the research principle: **"Don't jump to conclusions without real proof"**

### Incremental Validation Plan

**Phase 0: Prerequisites** (manual tests)
- Verify dlv installs and runs
- Test manual DAP connection
- Confirm protocol basics

**Phase 1: Process Management** (unit tests)
- Can spawn dlv?
- Can allocate port?
- Process stays alive?

**Phase 2: Socket Connection** (integration tests)
- Connection succeeds?
- Retry logic works?
- Timeout works?

**Phase 3: DAP Protocol** (protocol tests)
- Initialize request works?
- Launch request works?
- Capabilities correct?

**Phase 4: Debugging Operations** (feature tests)
- Breakpoints set?
- Stepping works?
- Variables readable?

**Phase 5: End-to-End** (integration test)
- FizzBuzz test passes?
- All features work together?

**Success = All 5 phases pass before claiming "it works"**
