# MCP Protocol Log - Rust Debugging Test

**Test Date:** 2025-10-17
**Language:** Rust
**Program:** /workspace/tests/fixtures/fizzbuzz.rs
**Session ID:** 4c2ce59e-84f7-4bb9-94e5-e16520460c41

---

## Test Summary

This test attempted to debug a Rust fizzbuzz program using the DAP MCP server. The test encountered issues with breakpoint verification, likely due to missing debug symbols in the compiled binary.

---

## Operation Log

### 1. List MCP Resources

**Tool:** `ListMcpResourcesTool`
**Server:** debugger-test-rust
**Status:** ✅ Success

**Resources Found:**
- `debugger://sessions` - List of all active debugging sessions
- `debugger://workflows` - Common debugging workflows
- `debugger://state-machine` - Session state machine diagram
- `debugger://error-handling` - Error handling guide
- Various documentation resources

---

### 2. Start Debug Session

**Tool:** `mcp__debugger-test-rust__debugger_start`
**Parameters:**
- language: `rust`
- program: `/workspace/tests/fixtures/fizzbuzz.rs`
- stopOnEntry: `true`

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "sessionId": "4c2ce59e-84f7-4bb9-94e5-e16520460c41",
  "status": "started"
}
```

---

### 3. Wait for Stop at Entry

**Tool:** `mcp__debugger-test-rust__debugger_wait_for_stop`
**Parameters:**
- sessionId: `4c2ce59e-84f7-4bb9-94e5-e16520460c41`
- timeoutMs: `5000`

**Result:** ⚠️ Unexpected State
```json
{
  "reason": "exception",
  "state": "Stopped",
  "threadId": 3809
}
```

**Analysis:** The program stopped due to an "exception" rather than the expected "entry" reason. This suggests the debugger encountered an issue during initialization or startup.

---

### 4. Set Breakpoint

**Tool:** `mcp__debugger-test-rust__debugger_set_breakpoint`
**Parameters:**
- sessionId: `4c2ce59e-84f7-4bb9-94e5-e16520460c41`
- sourcePath: `/workspace/tests/fixtures/fizzbuzz.rs`
- line: `5`

**Result:** ⚠️ Not Verified
```json
{
  "line": 5,
  "sourcePath": "/workspace/tests/fixtures/fizzbuzz.rs",
  "verified": false
}
```

**Analysis:** The breakpoint was set but NOT verified. This typically indicates:
- The binary lacks debug symbols
- The source file path doesn't match the compiled binary's debug info
- The line number is invalid or not executable

---

### 5. Retrieve Stack Trace

**Tool:** `mcp__debugger-test-rust__debugger_stack_trace`
**Parameters:**
- sessionId: `4c2ce59e-84f7-4bb9-94e5-e16520460c41`

**Result:** ✅ Success (but in unexpected location)
```json
{
  "stackFrames": [
    {
      "column": 0,
      "endColumn": null,
      "endLine": null,
      "id": 1001,
      "line": 291,
      "name": "___lldb_unnamed_symbol227",
      "source": {
        "name": "@___lldb_unnamed_symbol227",
        "path": null,
        "sourceReference": 1000
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Analysis:** The stack trace shows the debugger is inside an LLDB unnamed symbol, not in user code. This confirms we're in a runtime initialization or exception handling routine.

---

### 6. Continue Execution

**Tool:** `mcp__debugger-test-rust__debugger_continue`
**Parameters:**
- sessionId: `4c2ce59e-84f7-4bb9-94e5-e16520460c41`

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "status": "continued"
}
```

---

### 7. Wait for Stop (at breakpoint)

**Tool:** `mcp__debugger-test-rust__debugger_wait_for_stop`
**Parameters:**
- sessionId: `4c2ce59e-84f7-4bb9-94e5-e16520460c41`
- timeoutMs: `5000`

**Result:** ❌ Program Terminated
```json
{
  "reason": "Program exited",
  "state": "Terminated"
}
```

**Analysis:** The program ran to completion without stopping at the breakpoint, confirming the breakpoint was not active (due to not being verified).

---

### 8. Disconnect Session

**Tool:** `mcp__debugger-test-rust__debugger_disconnect`
**Parameters:**
- sessionId: `4c2ce59e-84f7-4bb9-94e5-e16520460c41`

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "status": "disconnected"
}
```

---

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Breakpoint Not Verified
**Severity:** High
**Impact:** Breakpoint was ignored during execution

**Root Cause:** The Rust binary likely was not compiled with debug symbols or the debug symbols are not in the expected DWARF format that CodeLLDB expects.

**Recommendation:**
- Ensure Rust programs are compiled with `rustc -g` or `cargo build` (not `cargo build --release`)
- Verify debug symbols with `nm` or `objdump`
- Consider using a pre-compiled debug binary

### 2. Exception on Entry
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Debugger stopped in runtime code instead of user code

**Root Cause:** Unclear - could be related to:
- LLDB initialization behavior
- Rust runtime initialization
- Exception breakpoint configuration

**Recommendation:**
- Investigate exception breakpoint configuration
- Check if this is expected behavior for Rust programs
- Test with a simpler Rust program

---

## Successful Operations

1. ✅ MCP resource listing
2. ✅ Debug session creation
3. ✅ Breakpoint setting (API call succeeded)
4. ✅ Stack trace retrieval
5. ✅ Continue execution
6. ✅ Session disconnection

---

## Failed/Incomplete Operations

1. ❌ Breakpoint verification (returned false)
2. ❌ Stopping at user-set breakpoint
3. ❌ Variable evaluation (couldn't test - no stop at breakpoint)

---

## Recommendations for Future Testing

1. **Pre-compile test binaries with debug symbols:**
   ```bash
   rustc -g fizzbuzz.rs -o fizzbuzz_debug
   ```

2. **Verify debug symbols before testing:**
   ```bash
   objdump -g fizzbuzz_debug | grep fizzbuzz
   ```

3. **Test exception breakpoint configuration:**
   - Configure exception breakpoints before starting
   - Understand Rust runtime exception behavior

4. **Test with simpler program:**
   - Single function, no loops
   - Verify basic breakpoint functionality first

5. **Investigate CodeLLDB requirements:**
   - Check if specific DWARF version needed
   - Verify CodeLLDB version compatibility

---

## Conclusion

The MCP debugger server successfully:
- Started a Rust debugging session
- Handled session lifecycle (start, continue, disconnect)
- Provided stack trace information
- Managed API communication properly

However, the test was unable to verify breakpoints or stop at user code due to what appears to be a debug symbols issue with the compiled Rust binary. The server's MCP protocol layer worked correctly, but the underlying DAP adapter (CodeLLDB) could not verify the breakpoint.

**Overall Assessment:** Partial success - MCP integration works, but Rust debugging requires proper debug symbol setup.
